1. Install sshd  on the server
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server

2. Verify in the ssh configuration files that only protocol version 2 is allowed.
	grep protocol /etc/ssh/ssh*_config

3. Use ssh to log on to the server, show your current directory and then exit the server.
	ssh student@147.90.0.1
	pwd
	exit

4. Use scp to copy a file from your computer to the server.
	scp ~/Desktop/homework.txt student@147.90.0.1:/workspases

5. Use scp to copy a file from the server to your computer.
	scp student@147.90.0.1:/workspases/homework.txt ~/Desktop/

6. (optional, only works when you have a graphical install of Linux) Install the xeyes package on the server and use ssh to run xeyes on the server, but display it on your client.
	student2:   sudo apt-get install xeyes
	student1:   ssh -X student2@ip2
		    xeyes

7. (optional, same as previous) Create a bookmark in firefox, then quit firefox on client and server. Use ssh -X  to run firefox on your display, but on your neighbour's computer. Do you see your neighbour's bookmark ?

8. Use ssh-keygen to create a key pair without passphrase. Setup passwordless ssh between you and your neighbour. (or between your client and your server)
	student1:   ssh-keygen -t rsa
		    cd ~/
	            sudo chmod 700 .ssh
	student2:   mkdir .ssh
		    sudo chmod 400 .ssh
	student1:   scp ~/.ssh/id_ssh.pub student1@ip1:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
		    cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
		    

9.Verify that the permissions on the server key files are correct; world readable for the public keys and only root access for the private keys.
	ls -l /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*

10. Verify that the ssh-agent  is running.
	ps fax | grep ssh-agent

11. (optional) Protect your keypair with a passphrase, then add this key to the ssh-agent and test your passwordless ssh to the server.
