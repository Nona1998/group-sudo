1. Create two directories with some files. Use nfs  to share one of them as read only, the other must be writable. Have your neighbour connect to them to test.
	mkdir ~/Desktop/dir1 ~/Desktop/dir2
	touch ~/Desktop/dir1/file1 ~/Desktop/dir2/file2
	sudo vim /etc/exports
		/home/nona/Desktop/dir1/file1 *(ro)
		/home/nona/Desktop/dir2/file2 *(rw)
	mount -t nfs ip:~/Desktop/dir1 /mnt
	mount -t nfs ip:~/Desktop/dir2 /mnt	

2. Investigate the user owner of the files created by your neighbour.

3. Protect a share by ip-address or hostname, so only your neighbour can connect.
	sudo vim /etc/exports
		/home/nona/Desktop/dir1/file1 student(rw)
